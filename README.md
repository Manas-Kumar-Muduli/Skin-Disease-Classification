Objectives

•	Disease Classification: Using AI algorithms, the main goal is to create a reliable and accurate system for classifying skin disorders. This is using clinical photos and other pertinent data to train models to distinguish between different skin conditions.

•	Early Detection: Use machine learning techniques to facilitate the early detection of skin disorders. For treatment and management to be effective and possibly improve patient outcomes while lessening the strain on healthcare systems, early identification is essential.

•	Accuracy Improvement: Boost skin disease diagnosis accuracy above and beyond conventional techniques. Large datasets may be analyzed by AI models, which may be able to spot details and patterns that are difficult for human analysts to notice.

•	Multi-Class Classification: Create a system that can manage a variety of skin conditions, such as acne, melanoma, psoriasis, and eczema. The goal is to create an adaptable model that can handle the wide range of dermatological disorders.
